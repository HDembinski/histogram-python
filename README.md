# boost-histogram for Python

[![Gitter][gitter-badge]][gitter-link]
[![Build Status][azure-badge]][azure-link]

Python bindings for [Boost::Histogram][] ([source][Boost::Histogram source]), a C++14 library. This should become one of the [fastest libraries][] for histogramming, while still providing the power of a full histogram object.

## Installation

This library is under development, but you can install directly from github if you would like. You need a C++14 compiler and Python 2.7--3.7.
All the normal best-practices for Python apply; you should be in a virtual environment, otherwise add `--user`, etc.

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram.git@develop
```

## Usage

This is a suggested example of usage.

```python
import boost.histogram as bh

# Compose axis however you like
hist = bh.make_histogram(bh.axis.regular(2, 0, 1),
                         bh.axis.regular(4, 0.0, 1.0))

# Filling can be done with arrays, one per diminsion
hist([.3, .5, .2],
     [.1, .4, .9])

# Numpy array view into histogram counts, no overflow bins
counts = hist.view()
```

## Features

* Many axis types (all support `metadata=...`)
    * `bh.axis.regular(n, start, stop)`: `n` evenly spaced bins from `start` to `stop`
    * `bh.axis.regular_noflow(n, start, stop)`: `regular` but with no underflow or overflow bins
    * `bh.axis.regular_growth(n, start, stop)`: `regular` but grows if a value is added outside the range
    * `bh.axis.circular(n, start, stop)`: Value outside the range wrap into the range
    * `bh.axis.regular_log(n, start, stop)`: Regularly spaced values in log 10 scale
    * `bh.axis.regular_sqrt(n, start, stop)`: Regularly spaced value in sqrt scale
    * `bh.axis.regular_pow(power, n, start, stop)`: Regularly spaced value to some `power`
    * `bh.axis.integer(start, stop)`: Special high-speed version of `regular` for evenly spaced bins of width 1
    * `bh.axis.variable([start, edge1, edge2, ..., stop])`: Uneven bin spacing
    * `bh.axis.category_int([1, 2, ...])`: Integer bins
    * `bh.axis.category_int_growth([1, 2, ...])`: Integer bins where new items are added automatically
    * `bh.axis.category_str(["item1", "item2", ...])`: String bins
    * `bh.axis.category_str_growth(["item1", "item2", ...])`: String bins where new items are added automatically
* Many storage types
    * `bh.storage.int`: 64 bit unsigned integers for high performance and useful view access
    * `bh.storage.double`: Doubles for weighted values
    * `bh.storage.unlimited`: Starts small, but can go up to unlimited precision ints or doubles.
    * `bh.storage.atomic_int`: Threadsafe filling, for higher performance on multhreaded backends. Does not support growing axis in threads.
    * `bh.storage.weight`: WIP
    * `bh.storage.profile`: WIP
    * `bh.storage.weighted_profile`: WIP
* Accumulators
    * `bh.accumulator.weighted_sum`: Tracks a weighted sum and variance
    * `bh.accumulator.weighted_mean`: Tracks a weighted sum, mean, and variance (West's incremental algorithm)
    * `bh.accumulator.sum`: High accuracy sum (Neumaier)
    * `bh.accumulator.mean`: Running count, mean, and variance (Welfords's incremental algorithm)
* Histogram operations
    * `(a, b, ...)`: Fill with arrays or single values
    * `+`: Add two histograms
    * `.rank()`: The number of dimensions
    * `.size()`: The number of bins (including under/overflow)
    * `.reset()`: Set counters to 0
    * `*=`: Multiply by a scaler (not all storages)
    * `/=`: Divide by a scaler (not all storages)
    * `.to_numpy(flow=False)`: Convert to a numpy style tuple (with or without under/overflow bins)
    * `.view(flow=False)`: Get a view on the bin contents (with or without under/overflow bins)
    * `np.asarray(...)`: Get a view on the bin contents with under/overflow bins
    * `.axis(i)`: Get the `i`th axis
    * `.at(i, j, ...)`: Get the bin contents as a location 
    * `.sum()`: The total count of all bins
* Details
    * Use `bh.make_histogram(..., storage=...)` to make a histogram (there are several different types) 
    * Several common combinations are optimized, such as 1 or 2D regular axes + int storage



## Developing

This repository has dependencies in submodules. Check out the repository like this:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram.git
cd boost-histogram
```


<details><summary>Faster version (click to expand)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram.git
cd boost-histogram
git submodule update --init --depth 10
```

</details>

Make a build directory and run CMake. If you have a specific Python you want to use, add `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python)` or similar to the CMake line.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

Run the unit tests (requires pytest and numpy). Use `ctest` or `make test`, like this:

```bash
make test
```

The tests require `numpy` and `pytest`. If you are using Python 2, you will need `futures` as well.

To install using the pip method for development instead, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
. .env/bin/activate
python -m pip install .[test]
```

You'll need to reinstall it if you want to rebuild.
